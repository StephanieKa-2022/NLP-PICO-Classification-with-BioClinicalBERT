# NLP-PICO-Classification-with-BioClinicalBERT
Implementation for PICO Classification using BioClinicalBERT model


For the implementation we use the dataset that have 7 main labels: AIMS (A), Participants (P), Intervention (I), Outcome (O), Method (M), Results (R), and Conclusion (C). 

The above labels are used for the PICO detection in clinical texts. 

When opening the .ipynb file in the environment, the .txt files need to be added as well
