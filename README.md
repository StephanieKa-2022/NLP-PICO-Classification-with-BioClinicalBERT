# NLP-PICO-Classification-with-BioClinicalBERT
Implementation for PICO Classification using BioClinicalBERT model


For the implementation we use the dataset that have 7 main labels: AIMS (A), Participants (P), Intervention (I), Outcome (O), Method (M), Results (R), and Conclusion (C). 

The above labels are used for the PICO detection in clinical texts.
